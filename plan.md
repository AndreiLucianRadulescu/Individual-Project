# Plan

* Age estimation from faces
* Andrei-Lucian Radulescu
* 2577007R
* Dr. Tanaya Guha

Week-by-week plan for the whole project.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1** Research into potential datasets for my task.
* **Week 2** Select datasets for my task.
* **Week 3** Select datasets for my task. Research into the related work on age estimation.
* **Week 4** Research into the related work on age estimation.
* **Week 5** Find the methods I'm going to use in my project.
* **Week 6** Get a deeper understanding of HOG. Implement a basic HOG feature extractor.
* **Week 7** Try different HOG parameters and monitor their impact.
* **Week 8** Get a better understanding of LBP.
* **Week 9** Try to implement LBP and test different parameters and their impact.
* **Week 10** Try to fit a binary classifier - SVM would be optimal.
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]** Write status report and present current state to supervisor. Try to implement multi-class classifier.
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.

## Winter break 
Learn about Convolutional Neural Networks. Do more research on related work.

## Spring Semester

* **Week 13** Change the logistic regression classifier to an SVM classifier.
* **Week 14** Research more about state-of-the-art models and their results.
* **Week 15** Get a better understanding of CNNs. 
* **Week 16** Perform hyper-parameter tuning for the classifiers. Find the best performing LBP and HOG models.
* **Week 17** Develop a very simple CNN. Try to test the basic CNN and see the results.
* **Week 18** Try building more complex architecture for baseline. 
* **Week 19** Try to solve overfitting. Look into more advanced architectures.
* **Week 20** Report the results of all CNNs to the supervisor. Start writing on dissertation.
* **Week 21** Keep writing on dissertation. Potentially do a GUI that predicts the age from webcam.
* **Week 22** Keep writing on dissertation.
* **Week 23 [TERM ENDS]** Keep writing on dissertation.
* **Week 24** Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
